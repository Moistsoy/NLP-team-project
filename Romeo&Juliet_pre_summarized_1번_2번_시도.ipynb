        "full_text = \"\"\"In the streets of Verona, another brawl breaks out between the servants of the feuding noble families of Capulet and Montague. Benvolio, a Montague, tries to stop the fighting, but he is himself embroiled when Tybalt, a rash Capulet, arrives on the scene. After citizens outraged by the constant violence beat back the warring factions, Prince Escalus, the ruler of Verona, attempts to prevent any further conflicts between the families by decreeing death for any individual who disturbs the peace in the future. Romeo, the son of Montague, runs into his cousin Benvolio, who had earlier seen Romeo moping in a grove of sycamores. After some prodding by Benvolio, Romeo confides that he is in love with Rosaline, a woman who does not return his affections. Benvolio counsels him to forget this woman and find another, more beautiful one, but Romeo remains despondent. Meanwhile, Paris, a kinsman of the Prince, seeks Juliet’s hand in marriage. Her father Capulet, though happy at the match, asks Paris to wait two years, since Juliet is not yet even fourteen. Capulet dispatches a servant with a list of people to invite to a masquerade and feast he traditionally holds. He invites Paris to the feast, hoping that Paris will begin to win Juliet’s heart. Romeo and Benvolio, still discussing Rosaline, encounter the Capulet servant bearing the list of invitations. Benvolio suggests that they attend, since that will allow Romeo to compare his beloved to other beautiful women of Verona. Romeo agrees to go with Benvolio to the feast, but only because Rosaline, whose name he reads on the list, will be there. In Capulet’s household, young Juliet talks with her mother, Lady Capulet, and her nurse about the possibility of marrying Paris. Juliet has not yet considered marriage, but agrees to look at Paris during the feast to see if she thinks she could fall in love with him. The feast begins. A melancholy Romeo follows Benvolio and their witty friend Mercutio to Capulet’s house. Once inside, Romeo sees Juliet from a distance and instantly falls in love with her; he forgets about Rosaline completely. As Romeo watches Juliet, entranced, a young Capulet, Tybalt, recognizes him, and is enraged that a Montague would sneak into a Capulet feast. He prepares to attack, but Capulet holds him back. Soon, Romeo speaks to Juliet, and the two experience a profound attraction. They kiss, not even knowing each other’s names. When he finds out from Juliet’s nurse that she is the daughter of Capulet—his family’s enemy—he becomes distraught. When Juliet learns that the young man she has just kissed is the son of Montague, she grows equally upset. As Mercutio and Benvolio leave the Capulet estate, Romeo leaps over the orchard wall into the garden, unable to leave Juliet behind. From his hiding place, he sees Juliet in a window above the orchard and hears her speak his name. He calls out to her, and they exchange vows of love. Romeo hurries to see his friend and confessor Friar Lawrence, who, though shocked at the sudden turn of Romeo’s heart, agrees to marry the young lovers in secret since he sees in their love the possibility of ending the age-old feud between Capulet and Montague. The following day, Romeo and Juliet meet at Friar Lawrence’s cell and are married. The Nurse, who is privy to the secret, procures a ladder, which Romeo will use to climb into Juliet’s window for their wedding night. The next day, Benvolio and Mercutio encounter Tybalt—Juliet’s cousin—who, still enraged that Romeo attended Capulet’s feast, has challenged Romeo to a duel. Romeo appears. Now Tybalt’s kinsman by marriage, Romeo begs the Capulet to hold off the duel until he understands why Romeo does not want to fight. Disgusted with this plea for peace, Mercutio says that he will fight Tybalt himself. The two begin to duel. Romeo tries to stop them by leaping between the combatants. Tybalt stabs Mercutio under Romeo’s arm, and Mercutio dies. Romeo, in a rage, kills Tybalt. Romeo flees from the scene. Soon after, the Prince declares him forever banished from Verona for his crime. Friar Lawrence arranges for Romeo to spend his wedding night with Juliet before he has to leave for Mantua the following morning. In her room, Juliet awaits the arrival of her new husband. The Nurse enters, and, after some confusion, tells Juliet that Romeo has killed Tybalt. Distraught, Juliet suddenly finds herself married to a man who has killed her kinsman. But she resettles herself, and realizes that her duty belongs with her love: to Romeo. Romeo sneaks into Juliet’s room that night, and at last they consummate their marriage and their love. Morning comes, and the lovers bid farewell, unsure when they will see each other again. Juliet learns that her father, affected by the recent events, now intends for her to marry Paris in just three days. Unsure of how to proceed—unable to reveal to her parents that she is married to Romeo, but unwilling to marry Paris now that she is Romeo’s wife—Juliet asks her nurse for advice. She counsels Juliet to proceed as if Romeo were dead and to marry Paris, who is a better match anyway. Disgusted with the Nurse’s disloyalty, Juliet disregards her advice and hurries to Friar Lawrence. He concocts a plan to reunite Juliet with Romeo in Mantua. The night before her wedding to Paris, Juliet must drink a potion that will make her appear to be dead. After she is laid to rest in the family’s crypt, the Friar and Romeo will secretly retrieve her, and she will be free to live with Romeo, away from their parents’ feuding. Juliet returns home to discover the wedding has been moved ahead one day, and she is to be married tomorrow. That night, Juliet drinks the potion, and the Nurse discovers her, apparently dead, the next morning. The Capulets grieve, and Juliet is entombed according to plan. But Friar Lawrence’s message explaining the plan to Romeo never reaches Mantua. Its bearer, Friar John, gets confined to a quarantined house. Romeo hears only that Juliet is dead. Romeo learns only of Juliet’s death and decides to kill himself rather than live without her. He buys a vial of poison from a reluctant Apothecary, then speeds back to Verona to take his own life at Juliet’s tomb. Outside the Capulet crypt, Romeo comes upon Paris, who is scattering flowers on Juliet’s grave. They fight, and Romeo kills Paris. He enters the tomb, sees Juliet’s inanimate body, drinks the poison, and dies by her side. Just then, Friar Lawrence enters and realizes that Romeo has killed Paris and himself. At the same time, Juliet awakes. Friar Lawrence hears the coming of the watch. When Juliet refuses to leave with him, he flees alone. Juliet sees her beloved Romeo and realizes he has killed himself with poison. She kisses his poisoned lips, and when that does not kill her, buries his dagger in her chest, falling dead upon his body. The watch arrives, followed closely by the Prince, the Capulets, and Montague. Montague declares that Lady Montague has died of grief over Romeo’s exile. Seeing their children’s bodies, Capulet and Montague agree to end their long-standing feud and to raise gold statues of their children side-by-side in a newly peaceful Verona.\"\"\""

Although I joy in thee,\\r\\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\\r\\nIt is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\\r\\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\\r\\nEre one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.\\r\\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\\r\\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\\r\\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\\r\\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\\r\\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\\r\\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;\\r\\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\\r\\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\\r\\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\\r\\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.\\r\\n[_Nurse calls within._]\\r\\nAnon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.\\r\\nStay but a little, I will come again.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,\\r\\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\\r\\nToo flattering sweet to be substantial.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\\r\\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\\r\\nThy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,\\r\\nBy one that I’ll procure to come to thee,\\r\\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite,\\r\\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay\\r\\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Within._] Madam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,\\r\\nI do beseech thee,—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Within._] Madam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by I come—\\r\\nTo cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.\\r\\nTomorrow will I send.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo thrive my soul,—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand times good night.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\\r\\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,\\r\\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Retiring slowly._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter Juliet, above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice\\r\\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again.\\r\\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\\r\\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\\r\\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\\r\\nWith repetition of my Romeo’s name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\\r\\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,\\r\\nLike softest music to attending ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy nyas?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\\r\\nShall I send to thee?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the hour of nine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\\r\\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\\r\\nRemembering how I love thy company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\\r\\nForgetting any other home but this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\\r\\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,\\r\\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\\r\\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\\r\\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\\r\\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI would I were thy bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet, so would I:\\r\\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\\r\\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\\r\\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\\r\\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\\r\\nThe grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,\\r\\nChequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\\r\\nAnd darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels\\r\\nFrom forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels\\r\\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\\r\\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\\r\\nThe day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\\r\\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours\\r\\nWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\\r\\nThe earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;\\r\\nWhat is her burying grave, that is her womb:\\r\\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\\r\\nWe sucking on her natural bosom find.\\r\\nMany for many virtues excellent,\\r\\nNone but for some, and yet all different.\\r\\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\\r\\nIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\\r\\nFor naught so vile that on the earth doth live\\r\\nBut to the earth some special good doth give;\\r\\nNor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,\\r\\nRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\\r\\nVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied,\\r\\nAnd vice sometime’s by action dignified.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the infant rind of this weak flower\\r\\nPoison hath residence, and medicine power:\\r\\nFor this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\\r\\nBeing tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\\r\\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\\r\\nIn man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\\r\\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\\r\\nFull soon the canker death eats up that plant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood morrow, father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBenedicite!\\r\\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\\r\\nYoung son, it argues a distemper’d head\\r\\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\\r\\nCare keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\\r\\nAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie;\\r\\nBut where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\\r\\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\\r\\nTherefore thy earliness doth me assure\\r\\nThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;\\r\\nOr if not so, then here I hit it right,\\r\\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\\r\\nI have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\\r\\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\\r\\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\\r\\nThat’s by me wounded. Both our remedies\\r\\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies.\\r\\nI bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,\\r\\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\\r\\nRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\\r\\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\\r\\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\\r\\nAnd all combin’d, save what thou must combine\\r\\nBy holy marriage. When, and where, and how\\r\\nWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,\\r\\nI’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\\r\\nThat thou consent to marry us today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!\\r\\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\\r\\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\\r\\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\\r\\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\\r\\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\\r\\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\\r\\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\\r\\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\\r\\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\\r\\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\\r\\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\\r\\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\\r\\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\\r\\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\\r\\nWomen may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot in a grave\\r\\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\\r\\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\\r\\nThe other did not so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, she knew well\\r\\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\\r\\nBut come young waverer, come go with me,\\r\\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\\r\\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\\r\\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\\r\\nthat he will sure run mad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA challenge, on my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo will answer it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\\r\\neye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\\r\\ncleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\\r\\nTybalt?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\\r\\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\\r\\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\\r\\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\\r\\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\\r\\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe what?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\\r\\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\\r\\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\\r\\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\\r\\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\\r\\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\\r\\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\\r\\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\\r\\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\\r\\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\\r\\nRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\\r\\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\\r\\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\\r\\nin the hams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMeaning, to curtsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA most courteous exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPink for flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\\r\\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\\r\\nwearing, solely singular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\\r\\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\\r\\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\\r\\ngoose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, good goose, bite not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\\r\\nell broad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\\r\\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\\r\\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as\\r\\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\r\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStop there, stop there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\r\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s goodly gear!\\r\\nA sail, a sail!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fan, Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it good-den?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\r\\nprick of noon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\r\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\r\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\r\\nfault of a worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hast thou found?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\r\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\r\\n[_Sings._]\\r\\n    An old hare hoar,\\r\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\r\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\r\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\r\\n    Is too much for a score\\r\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\r\\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\r\\nropery?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\r\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\r\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\r\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\r\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\r\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\r\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\r\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\r\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\r\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\r\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\r\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\r\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\r\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\r\\nvery weak dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\n Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\r\\nthee,—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\r\\nbe a joyful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\r\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBid her devise\\r\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\r\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\r\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\r\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\r\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\r\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\r\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\r\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\r\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\r\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\r\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\r\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\r\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\r\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\r\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\r\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\r\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\r\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Romeo._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore and apace.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\\r\\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\\r\\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\\r\\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\\r\\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\\r\\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\\r\\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\\r\\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\\r\\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\\r\\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\\r\\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\\r\\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\\r\\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\\r\\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\\r\\nAnd his to me.\\r\\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\\r\\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nO God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\\r\\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter, stay at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Peter._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\\r\\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\\r\\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\\r\\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\\r\\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\\r\\nNay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\\r\\nout of breath?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\\r\\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\\r\\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\r\\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\r\\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\\r\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\r\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\r\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\r\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\r\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\r\\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\r\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\\r\\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\r\\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\r\\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\\r\\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\\r\\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\r\\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\\r\\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\\r\\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\\r\\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest.\\r\\n‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\\r\\n‘Where is your mother?’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO God’s lady dear,\\r\\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\\r\\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\\r\\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;\\r\\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\\r\\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\\r\\nThey’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\\r\\nHie you to church. I must another way,\\r\\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\\r\\nMust climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\\r\\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\\r\\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\\r\\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\\r\\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\\r\\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\\r\\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\\r\\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\\r\\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\\r\\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\\r\\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\\r\\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\\r\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\r\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\r\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\r\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\r\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\r\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\r\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\r\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\r\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\r\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\r\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\r\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\r\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\r\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\r\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\r\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\r\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\r\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\r\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\\r\\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\\r\\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\r\\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\\r\\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\\r\\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\\r\\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I like such a fellow?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\\r\\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what to?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\\r\\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\r\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\r\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\r\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\r\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\r\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\r\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\r\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\r\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\r\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\r\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\r\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fee simple! O simple!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Tybalt and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy my heel, I care not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\\r\\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\\r\\nword and a blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\r\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\\r\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\r\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\r\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\r\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\r\\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\r\\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\\r\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\r\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\r\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\r\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\r\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\r\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\\r\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\r\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\r\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\r\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\r\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\r\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\r\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\r\\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\\r\\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, sir, your passado.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\r\\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\\r\\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\r\\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\r\\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am hurt.\\r\\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\\r\\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat, art thou hurt?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.\\r\\nWhere is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Page._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\\r\\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\r\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\r\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\r\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\r\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought all for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\r\\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\\r\\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\\r\\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\\r\\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\\r\\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\\r\\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\\r\\nHath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\\r\\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\\r\\nAnd in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter Benvolio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\\r\\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,\\r\\nWhich too untimely here did scorn the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\\r\\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\\r\\nAway to heaven respective lenity,\\r\\nAnd fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\\r\\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again\\r\\nThat late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\\r\\nIs but a little way above our heads,\\r\\nStaying for thine to keep him company.\\r\\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\\r\\nShalt with him hence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shall determine that.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo, away, be gone!\\r\\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\\r\\nStand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death\\r\\nIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, I am fortune’s fool!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy dost thou stay?\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Romeo._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?\\r\\nTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere lies that Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUp, sir, go with me.\\r\\nI charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO noble Prince, I can discover all\\r\\nThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\\r\\nThere lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\\r\\nThat slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nTybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!\\r\\nO Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d\\r\\nOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\\r\\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\\r\\nO cousin, cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\\r\\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\\r\\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\\r\\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\\r\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\r\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\r\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\r\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\r\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\r\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\r\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\r\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\r\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\r\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\r\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\r\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\r\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\r\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\r\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\r\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\r\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\r\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\r\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\r\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\r\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\r\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\r\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\r\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\r\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\r\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\r\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\r\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for that offence\\r\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\r\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\r\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\r\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\r\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\r\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\r\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\r\\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\\r\\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\\r\\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\\r\\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\\r\\nTowards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner\\r\\nAs Phaeton would whip you to the west\\r\\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\\r\\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\\r\\nThat runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo\\r\\nLeap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.\\r\\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\\r\\nBy their own beauties: or, if love be blind,\\r\\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\\r\\nThou sober-suited matron, all in black,\\r\\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\\r\\nPlay’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\\r\\nHood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,\\r\\nWith thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,\\r\\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\\r\\nCome, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;\\r\\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\\r\\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\\r\\nCome gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,\\r\\nGive me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\\r\\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\\r\\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\\r\\nThat all the world will be in love with night,\\r\\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\\r\\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,\\r\\nBut not possess’d it; and though I am sold,\\r\\nNot yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day\\r\\nAs is the night before some festival\\r\\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\\r\\nAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,\\r\\nAnd she brings news, and every tongue that speaks\\r\\nBut Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse, with cords.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?\\r\\nThe cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy, ay, the cords.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Throws them down._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!\\r\\nWe are undone, lady, we are undone.\\r\\nAlack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCan heaven be so envious?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo can,\\r\\nThough heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.\\r\\nWho ever would have thought it? Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\\r\\nThis torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.\\r\\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,\\r\\nAnd that bare vowel I shall poison more\\r\\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\\r\\nI am not I if there be such an I;\\r\\nOr those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.\\r\\nIf he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.\\r\\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\\r\\nGod save the mark!—here on his manly breast.\\r\\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\\r\\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,\\r\\nAll in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.\\r\\nTo prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.\\r\\nVile earth to earth resign; end motion here,\\r\\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.\\r\\nO courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!\\r\\nThat ever I should live to see thee dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?\\r\\nIs Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?\\r\\nMy dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?\\r\\nThen dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,\\r\\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,\\r\\nRomeo that kill’d him, he is banished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did, it did; alas the day, it did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!\\r\\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\\r\\nBeautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,\\r\\nDove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!\\r\\nDespised substance of divinest show!\\r\\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem’st,\\r\\nA damned saint, an honourable villain!\\r\\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\\r\\nWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\\r\\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\\r\\nWas ever book containing such vile matter\\r\\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\\r\\nIn such a gorgeous palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s no trust,\\r\\nNo faith, no honesty in men.

I would forget it fain,\\r\\nBut O, it presses to my memory\\r\\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.\\r\\nTybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\\r\\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’\\r\\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\\r\\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there.\\r\\nOr if sour woe delights in fellowship,\\r\\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,\\r\\nWhy follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\\r\\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both,\\r\\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov’d?\\r\\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,\\r\\n‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\\r\\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\\r\\nAll slain, all dead.

What is the Prince’s doom?\\r\\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\\r\\nThat I yet know not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nToo familiar\\r\\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\\r\\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\\r\\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\\r\\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\\r\\nMuch more than death. Do not say banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\\r\\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\\r\\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\\r\\nHence banished is banish’d from the world,\\r\\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\\r\\nIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\\r\\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\\r\\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\\r\\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\\r\\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\\r\\nAnd turn’d that black word death to banishment.\\r\\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\\r\\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\\r\\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\r\\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\\r\\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\\r\\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\\r\\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\\r\\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\\r\\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\r\\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\\r\\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\\r\\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\\r\\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\\r\\nThey are free men but I am banished.\\r\\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\\r\\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\\r\\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\\r\\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\\r\\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\\r\\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,\\r\\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\r\\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\\r\\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\\r\\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\\r\\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\\r\\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\r\\nDisplant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\\r\\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\r\\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\r\\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\r\\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\\r\\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\r\\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\\r\\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Knocking within._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArise; one knocks.

Even so lies she,\\r\\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\\r\\nStand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.\\r\\nFor Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.\\r\\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\\r\\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\\r\\nNow I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\\r\\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?\\r\\nWhere is she? And how doth she? And what says\\r\\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\\r\\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\\r\\nAnd Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\\r\\nAnd then down falls again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if that name,\\r\\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\\r\\nDid murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\\r\\nMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,\\r\\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\\r\\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\\r\\nThe hateful mansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Drawing his sword._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHold thy desperate hand.\\r\\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.\\r\\nThy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\\r\\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\\r\\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man,\\r\\nAnd ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\\r\\nThou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,\\r\\nI thought thy disposition better temper’d.\\r\\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\\r\\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,\\r\\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\\r\\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?\\r\\nSince birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet\\r\\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\\r\\nFie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\\r\\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,\\r\\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\\r\\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\\r\\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax,\\r\\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\\r\\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\\r\\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;\\r\\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\\r\\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\\r\\nLike powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\\r\\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\\r\\nAnd thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\\r\\nWhat, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,\\r\\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\\r\\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\\r\\nBut thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.\\r\\nThe law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,\\r\\nAnd turns it to exile; there art thou happy.\\r\\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\\r\\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\\r\\nBut like a misshaped and sullen wench,\\r\\nThou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.\\r\\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\\r\\nGo, get thee to thy love as was decreed,\\r\\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\\r\\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\\r\\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua;\\r\\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\\r\\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\\r\\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\\r\\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\\r\\nThan thou went’st forth in lamentation.\\r\\nGo before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\\r\\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,\\r\\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\\r\\nRomeo is coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night\\r\\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\\r\\nMy lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.\\r\\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow well my comfort is reviv’d by this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo hence, good night, and here stands all your state:\\r\\nEither be gone before the watch be set,\\r\\nOr by the break of day disguis’d from hence.\\r\\nSojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,\\r\\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\\r\\nEvery good hap to you that chances here.\\r\\nGive me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,\\r\\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\\r\\nFarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThings have fallen out, sir, so unluckily\\r\\nThat we have had no time to move our daughter.\\r\\nLook you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\\r\\nAnd so did I. Well, we were born to die.\\r\\n’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.\\r\\nI promise you, but for your company,\\r\\nI would have been abed an hour ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese times of woe afford no tune to woo.\\r\\nMadam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nI will, and know her mind early tomorrow;\\r\\nTonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\\r\\nOf my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d\\r\\nIn all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\\r\\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed,\\r\\nAcquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,\\r\\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,\\r\\nBut, soft, what day is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMonday, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\\r\\nA Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,\\r\\nShe shall be married to this noble earl.\\r\\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?\\r\\nWe’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,\\r\\nFor, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\\r\\nIt may be thought we held him carelessly,\\r\\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much.\\r\\nTherefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,\\r\\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\\r\\nGo you to Juliet ere you go to bed,\\r\\nPrepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\\r\\nFarewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!\\r\\nAfore me, it is so very very late that we\\r\\nMay call it early by and by. Good night.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo and Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\\r\\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\\r\\nThat pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;\\r\\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\\r\\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\\r\\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\\r\\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\\r\\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\\r\\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\\r\\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\\r\\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales\\r\\nTo be to thee this night a torchbearer\\r\\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.\\r\\nTherefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,\\r\\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so.\\r\\nI’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,\\r\\n’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.\\r\\nNor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\\r\\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\\r\\nI have more care to stay than will to go.\\r\\nCome, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\\r\\nHow is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.\\r\\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\\r\\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\\r\\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\\r\\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us.\\r\\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.\\r\\nO, now I would they had chang’d voices too,\\r\\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\\r\\nHunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\\r\\nO now be gone, more light and light it grows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNurse?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\\r\\nThe day is broke, be wary, look about.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Descends._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,\\r\\nI must hear from thee every day in the hour,\\r\\nFor in a minute there are many days.\\r\\nO, by this count I shall be much in years\\r\\nEre I again behold my Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFarewell!\\r\\nI will omit no opportunity\\r\\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve\\r\\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO God! I have an ill-divining soul!\\r\\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art so low,\\r\\nAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\\r\\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\\r\\nDry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit below._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,\\r\\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\\r\\nThat is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;\\r\\nFor then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long\\r\\nBut send him back.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?\\r\\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?\\r\\nWhat unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lady Capulet.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy, how now, Juliet?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam, I am not well.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?\\r\\nWhat, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\\r\\nAnd if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\\r\\nTherefore have done: some grief shows much of love,\\r\\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\\r\\nWhich you weep for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFeeling so the loss,\\r\\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nWell, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death\\r\\nAs that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat villain, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThat same villain Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.\\r\\nGod pardon him. I do, with all my heart.\\r\\nAnd yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy madam, from the reach of these my hands.\\r\\nWould none but I might venge my cousin’s death.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\\r\\nThen weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,\\r\\nWhere that same banish’d runagate doth live,\\r\\nShall give him such an unaccustom’d dram\\r\\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company:\\r\\nAnd then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed I never shall be satisfied\\r\\nWith Romeo till I behold him—dead—\\r\\nIs my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.\\r\\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\\r\\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it,\\r\\nThat Romeo should upon receipt thereof,\\r\\nSoon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\\r\\nTo hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,\\r\\nTo wreak the love I bore my cousin\\r\\nUpon his body that hath slaughter’d him.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nFind thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.\\r\\nBut now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time.\\r\\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\\r\\nOne who to put thee from thy heaviness,\\r\\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy,\\r\\nThat thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn\\r\\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\\r\\nThe County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,\\r\\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,\\r\\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride.\\r\\nI wonder at this haste, that I must wed\\r\\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo.\\r\\nI pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\\r\\nI will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\\r\\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\\r\\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nHere comes your father, tell him so yourself,\\r\\nAnd see how he will take it at your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Capulet and Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;\\r\\nBut for the sunset of my brother’s son\\r\\nIt rains downright.\\r\\nHow now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\\r\\nEvermore showering? In one little body\\r\\nThou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.\\r\\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\\r\\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\\r\\nSailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,\\r\\nWho raging with thy tears and they with them,\\r\\nWithout a sudden calm will overset\\r\\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\\r\\nHave you deliver’d to her our decree?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAy, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\\r\\nI would the fool were married to her grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSoft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.\\r\\nHow, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\\r\\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\\r\\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought\\r\\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have.\\r\\nProud can I never be of what I hate;\\r\\nBut thankful even for hate that is meant love.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?\\r\\nProud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;\\r\\nAnd yet not proud. Mistress minion you,\\r\\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\\r\\nBut fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next\\r\\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,\\r\\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\\r\\nOut, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\\r\\nYou tallow-face!\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nFie, fie! What, are you mad?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,\\r\\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!\\r\\nI tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,\\r\\nOr never after look me in the face.\\r\\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me.\\r\\nMy fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\\r\\nThat God had lent us but this only child;\\r\\nBut now I see this one is one too much,\\r\\nAnd that we have a curse in having her.\\r\\nOut on her, hilding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod in heaven bless her.\\r\\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,\\r\\nGood prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI speak no treason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO God ye good-en!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMay not one speak?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace, you mumbling fool!\\r\\nUtter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,\\r\\nFor here we need it not.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nYou are too hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod’s bread, it makes me mad!\\r\\nDay, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,\\r\\nAlone, in company, still my care hath been\\r\\nTo have her match’d, and having now provided\\r\\nA gentleman of noble parentage,\\r\\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,\\r\\nStuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,\\r\\nProportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,\\r\\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\\r\\nA whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,\\r\\nTo answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,\\r\\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me.’\\r\\nBut, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.\\r\\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\\r\\nLook to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.\\r\\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.\\r\\nAnd you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;\\r\\nAnd you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\\r\\nFor by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,\\r\\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\\r\\nTrust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,\\r\\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\\r\\nO sweet my mother, cast me not away,\\r\\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week,\\r\\nOr, if you do not, make the bridal bed\\r\\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nTalk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.\\r\\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO God!

Comfort me, counsel me.\\r\\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\\r\\nUpon so soft a subject as myself.\\r\\nWhat say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\\r\\nSome comfort, Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFaith, here it is.\\r\\nRomeo is banished; and all the world to nothing\\r\\nThat he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.\\r\\nOr if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\\r\\nThen, since the case so stands as now it doth,\\r\\nI think it best you married with the County.\\r\\nO, he’s a lovely gentleman.\\r\\nRomeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\\r\\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\\r\\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\\r\\nI think you are happy in this second match,\\r\\nFor it excels your first: or if it did not,\\r\\nYour first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,\\r\\nAs living here and you no use of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeakest thou from thy heart?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd from my soul too,\\r\\nOr else beshrew them both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\\r\\nGo in, and tell my lady I am gone,\\r\\nHaving displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,\\r\\nTo make confession and to be absolv’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient damnation!

Go, counsellor.\\r\\nThou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\\r\\nI’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.\\r\\nIf all else fail, myself have power to die.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, sir? The time is very short.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\\r\\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\\r\\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\\r\\nAnd therefore have I little talk’d of love;\\r\\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\\r\\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\\r\\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway;\\r\\nAnd in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,\\r\\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\\r\\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\\r\\nMay be put from her by society.\\r\\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—\\r\\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat must be shall be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s a certain text.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome you to make confession to this father?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will confess to you that I love him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,\\r\\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tears have got small victory by that;\\r\\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\\r\\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.\\r\\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\\r\\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—\\r\\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—\\r\\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,\\r\\nTill then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\\r\\nCome weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;\\r\\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\\r\\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\\r\\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\\r\\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\\r\\nIf in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\\r\\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\\r\\nAnd with this knife I’ll help it presently.\\r\\nGod join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;\\r\\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\\r\\nShall be the label to another deed,\\r\\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\\r\\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\\r\\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\\r\\nGive me some present counsel, or behold\\r\\n’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\\r\\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\\r\\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\\r\\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\\r\\nBe not so long to speak.

Go home, be merry, give consent\\r\\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\\r\\nTomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\\r\\nLet not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\\r\\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\\r\\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off,\\r\\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\\r\\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\\r\\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease.\\r\\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,\\r\\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\\r\\nTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,\\r\\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life.\\r\\nEach part depriv’d of supple government,\\r\\nShall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\\r\\nAnd in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death\\r\\nThou shalt continue two and forty hours,\\r\\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\\r\\nNow when the bridegroom in the morning comes\\r\\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\\r\\nThen as the manner of our country is,\\r\\nIn thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,\\r\\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\\r\\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\\r\\nIn the meantime, against thou shalt awake,\\r\\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\\r\\nAnd hither shall he come, and he and I\\r\\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\\r\\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\\r\\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\\r\\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\\r\\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\\r\\nIn this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed\\r\\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLove give me strength, and strength shall help afford.\\r\\nFarewell, dear father.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many guests invite as here are writ.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit first Servant._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nYou shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their\\r\\nfingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow canst thou try them so?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nMarry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;\\r\\ntherefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo, begone.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit second Servant._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.\\r\\nWhat, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy, forsooth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, he may chance to do some good on her.\\r\\nA peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSee where she comes from shrift with merry look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin\\r\\nOf disobedient opposition\\r\\nTo you and your behests; and am enjoin’d\\r\\nBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,\\r\\nTo beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.\\r\\nHenceforward I am ever rul’d by you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSend for the County, go tell him of this.\\r\\nI’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,\\r\\nAnd gave him what becomed love I might,\\r\\nNot stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.\\r\\nThis is as’t should be. Let me see the County.\\r\\nAy, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.\\r\\nNow afore God, this reverend holy Friar,\\r\\nAll our whole city is much bound to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet,\\r\\nTo help me sort such needful ornaments\\r\\nAs you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nNo, not till Thursday. There is time enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nWe shall be short in our provision,\\r\\n’Tis now near night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTush, I will stir about,\\r\\nAnd all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.\\r\\nGo thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.\\r\\nI’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.\\r\\nI’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—\\r\\nThey are all forth: well, I will walk myself\\r\\nTo County Paris, to prepare him up\\r\\nAgainst tomorrow.

And yet methinks it should not,\\r\\nFor he hath still been tried a holy man.\\r\\nHow if, when I am laid into the tomb,\\r\\nI wake before the time that Romeo\\r\\nCome to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!\\r\\nShall I not then be stifled in the vault,\\r\\nTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\\r\\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\\r\\nOr, if I live, is it not very like,\\r\\nThe horrible conceit of death and night,\\r\\nTogether with the terror of the place,\\r\\nAs in a vault, an ancient receptacle,\\r\\nWhere for this many hundred years the bones\\r\\nOf all my buried ancestors are pack’d,\\r\\nWhere bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\\r\\nLies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,\\r\\nAt some hours in the night spirits resort—\\r\\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I,\\r\\nSo early waking, what with loathsome smells,\\r\\nAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\\r\\nThat living mortals, hearing them, run mad.\\r\\nO, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\\r\\nEnvironed with all these hideous fears,\\r\\nAnd madly play with my forefathers’ joints?\\r\\nAnd pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?\\r\\nAnd, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,\\r\\nAs with a club, dash out my desperate brains?\\r\\nO look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost\\r\\nSeeking out Romeo that did spit his body\\r\\nUpon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!\\r\\nRomeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Throws herself on the bed._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nHold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey call for dates and quinces in the pastry.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Capulet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, stir, stir, stir!

What! I have watch’d ere now\\r\\nAll night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAy, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;\\r\\nBut I will watch you from such watching now.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, fellow, what’s there?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST \\r\\nThings for the cook, sir; but I know not what.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMake haste, make haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit First Servant._]\\r\\n\\r\\n—Sirrah, fetch drier logs.\\r\\nCall Peter, he will show thee where they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nI have a head, sir, that will find out logs\\r\\nAnd never trouble Peter for the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha.\\r\\nThou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.\\r\\nThe County will be here with music straight,\\r\\nFor so he said he would.

Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,\\r\\nHer blood is settled and her joints are stiff.\\r\\nLife and these lips have long been separated.\\r\\nDeath lies on her like an untimely frost\\r\\nUpon the sweetest flower of all the field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO lamentable day!\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nO woful time!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,\\r\\nTies up my tongue and will not let me speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, is the bride ready to go to church?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReady to go, but never to return.\\r\\nO son, the night before thy wedding day\\r\\nHath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,\\r\\nFlower as she was, deflowered by him.\\r\\nDeath is my son-in-law, death is my heir;\\r\\nMy daughter he hath wedded.

O child! My soul, and not my child,\\r\\nDead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,\\r\\nAnd with my child my joys are buried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not\\r\\nIn these confusions. Heaven and yourself\\r\\nHad part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,\\r\\nAnd all the better is it for the maid.\\r\\nYour part in her you could not keep from death,\\r\\nBut heaven keeps his part in eternal life.\\r\\nThe most you sought was her promotion,\\r\\nFor ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,\\r\\nAnd weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d\\r\\nAbove the clouds, as high as heaven itself?\\r\\nO, in this love, you love your child so ill\\r\\nThat you run mad, seeing that she is well.\\r\\nShe’s not well married that lives married long,\\r\\nBut she’s best married that dies married young.\\r\\nDry up your tears, and stick your rosemary\\r\\nOn this fair corse, and, as the custom is,\\r\\nAnd in her best array bear her to church;\\r\\nFor though fond nature bids us all lament,\\r\\nYet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll things that we ordained festival\\r\\nTurn from their office to black funeral:\\r\\nOur instruments to melancholy bells,\\r\\nOur wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;\\r\\nOur solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;\\r\\nOur bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,\\r\\nAnd all things change them to the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,\\r\\nAnd go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare\\r\\nTo follow this fair corse unto her grave.\\r\\nThe heavens do lower upon you for some ill;\\r\\nMove them no more by crossing their high will.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFaith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHonest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,\\r\\nFor well you know this is a pitiful case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAy, by my troth, the case may be amended.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Nurse._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you\\r\\nwill have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy ‘Heart’s ease’?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play\\r\\nme some merry dump to comfort me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will not then?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will then give it you soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will you give us?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen will I give you the serving-creature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will\\r\\ncarry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you re us and fa us, you note us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and\\r\\nput up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.\\r\\n    ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,\\r\\n      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,\\r\\n    Then music with her silver sound’—\\r\\nWhy ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,\\r\\nSimon Catling?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrates too! What say you, James Soundpost?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MUSICIAN.\\r\\nFaith, I know not what to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is\\r\\n‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for\\r\\nsounding.\\r\\n      ‘Then music with her silver sound\\r\\n      With speedy help doth lend redress.’\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a pestilent knave is this same!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay\\r\\ndinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,\\r\\nMy dreams presage some joyful news at hand.\\r\\nMy bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;\\r\\nAnd all this day an unaccustom’d spirit\\r\\nLifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\\r\\nI dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—\\r\\nStrange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—\\r\\nAnd breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,\\r\\nThat I reviv’d, and was an emperor.\\r\\nAh me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,\\r\\nWhen but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Balthasar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNews from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\\r\\nDost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?\\r\\nHow doth my lady? Is my father well?\\r\\nHow fares my Juliet? That I ask again;\\r\\nFor nothing can be ill if she be well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she is well, and nothing can be ill.\\r\\nHer body sleeps in Capel’s monument,\\r\\nAnd her immortal part with angels lives.\\r\\nI saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,\\r\\nAnd presently took post to tell it you.\\r\\nO pardon me for bringing these ill news,\\r\\nSince you did leave it for my office, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it even so? Then I defy you, stars!\\r\\nThou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,\\r\\nAnd hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI do beseech you sir, have patience.\\r\\nYour looks are pale and wild, and do import\\r\\nSome misadventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTush, thou art deceiv’d.\\r\\nLeave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.\\r\\nHast thou no letters to me from the Friar?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, my good lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter. Get thee gone,\\r\\nAnd hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Balthasar._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.\\r\\nLet’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift\\r\\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\\r\\nI do remember an apothecary,—\\r\\nAnd hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\\r\\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\\r\\nCulling of simples, meagre were his looks,\\r\\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\\r\\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\\r\\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins\\r\\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\\r\\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\\r\\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\\r\\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\\r\\nWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\\r\\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\\r\\nAnd if a man did need a poison now,\\r\\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\\r\\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\\r\\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\\r\\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\\r\\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\\r\\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\\r\\nWhat, ho! Apothecary!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Apothecary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho calls so loud?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\\r\\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\\r\\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\\r\\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\\r\\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\\r\\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath\\r\\nAs violently as hasty powder fir’d\\r\\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law\\r\\nIs death to any he that utters them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\\r\\nAnd fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\\r\\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\\r\\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\\r\\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;\\r\\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\\r\\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy poverty, but not my will consents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\\r\\nAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strength\\r\\nOf twenty men, it would despatch you straight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,\\r\\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\\r\\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\\r\\nI sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.\\r\\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\\r\\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\\r\\nTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar John.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John.\\r\\nWelcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\\r\\nOr, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\\r\\nOne of our order, to associate me,\\r\\nHere in this city visiting the sick,\\r\\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,\\r\\nSuspecting that we both were in a house\\r\\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,\\r\\nSeal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\\r\\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho bare my letter then to Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not send it,—here it is again,—\\r\\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,\\r\\nSo fearful were they of infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\\r\\nThe letter was not nice, but full of charge,\\r\\nOf dear import, and the neglecting it\\r\\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\\r\\nGet me an iron crow and bring it straight\\r\\nUnto my cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrother, I’ll go and bring it thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow must I to the monument alone.\\r\\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\\r\\nShe will beshrew me much that Romeo\\r\\nHath had no notice of these accidents;\\r\\nBut I will write again to Mantua,\\r\\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come.\\r\\nPoor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.\\r\\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen.\\r\\nUnder yond yew tree lay thee all along,\\r\\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground;\\r\\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,\\r\\nBeing loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,\\r\\nBut thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\\r\\nAs signal that thou hear’st something approach.\\r\\nGive me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone\\r\\nHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Retires._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.\\r\\nO woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,\\r\\nWhich with sweet water nightly I will dew,\\r\\nOr wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.\\r\\nThe obsequies that I for thee will keep,\\r\\nNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_The Page whistles._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy gives warning something doth approach.\\r\\nWhat cursed foot wanders this way tonight,\\r\\nTo cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?\\r\\nWhat, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Retires._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\\r\\nHold, take this letter; early in the morning\\r\\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\\r\\nGive me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,\\r\\nWhate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof\\r\\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\\r\\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\\r\\nIs partly to behold my lady’s face,\\r\\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\\r\\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use\\r\\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\\r\\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\\r\\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\\r\\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\\r\\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\r\\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\\r\\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\\r\\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\\r\\nLive, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.\\r\\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Retires_]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\\r\\nGorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\\r\\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague\\r\\nThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,\\r\\nIt is supposed, the fair creature died,—\\r\\nAnd here is come to do some villanous shame\\r\\nTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Advances._]\\r\\n\\r\\nStop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.\\r\\nCan vengeance be pursu’d further than death?\\r\\nCondemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\\r\\nObey, and go with me, for thou must die.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\\r\\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.\\r\\nFly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\\r\\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\\r\\nPut not another sin upon my head\\r\\nBy urging me to fury. O be gone.\\r\\nBy heaven I love thee better than myself;\\r\\nFor I come hither arm’d against myself.\\r\\nStay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,\\r\\nA madman’s mercy bid thee run away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI do defy thy conjuration,\\r\\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,\\r\\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Dies._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\\r\\nMercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!\\r\\nWhat said my man, when my betossed soul\\r\\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\\r\\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\r\\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\\r\\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\\r\\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\r\\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\\r\\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\r\\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\\r\\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\r\\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\\r\\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\\r\\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call\\r\\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\\r\\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,\\r\\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\\r\\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\r\\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\\r\\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\r\\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\\r\\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\r\\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\\r\\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\r\\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\\r\\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\\r\\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\r\\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\\r\\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\r\\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\\r\\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\\r\\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\\r\\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\\r\\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\r\\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\\r\\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\r\\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\\r\\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\\r\\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\r\\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\\r\\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\\r\\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\r\\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\\r\\nHere’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!\\r\\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Dies._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a\\r\\n lantern, crow, and spade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight\\r\\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?\\r\\nWho is it that consorts, so late, the dead?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,\\r\\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\\r\\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\\r\\nIt burneth in the Capels’ monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,\\r\\nOne that you love.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long hath he been there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFull half an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo with me to the vault.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI dare not, sir;\\r\\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\\r\\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\\r\\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\\r\\nO, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\\r\\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\\r\\nAnd that my master slew him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo! [_Advances._]\\r\\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\\r\\nThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\r\\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\\r\\nTo lie discolour’d by this place of peace?\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Enters the monument._]\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\\r\\nAnd steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour\\r\\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance?\\r\\nThe lady stirs.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO comfortable Friar, where is my lord?\\r\\nI do remember well where I should be,\\r\\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Noise within._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\\r\\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\\r\\nA greater power than we can contradict\\r\\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\\r\\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\\r\\nAnd Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee\\r\\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\\r\\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\\r\\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?\\r\\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\r\\nO churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop\\r\\nTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\\r\\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them,\\r\\nTo make me die with a restorative.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Kisses him._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThy lips are warm!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\\r\\nGo, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,\\r\\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\\r\\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.\\r\\nGo tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.\\r\\nRaise up the Montagues, some others search.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\\r\\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\\r\\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nHere’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD  Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\\r\\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him\\r\\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter the Prince and Attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\\r\\nThat calls our person from our morning’s rest?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,\\r\\nSome Juliet, and some Paris, and all run\\r\\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\\r\\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\\r\\nWarm and new kill’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,\\r\\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\\r\\nThese dead men’s tombs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\r\\nThis dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\\r\\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\\r\\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\\r\\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Montague and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\\r\\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\\r\\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.\\r\\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, and thou shalt see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\\r\\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\r\\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\\r\\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent,\\r\\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\\r\\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\r\\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\\r\\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\\r\\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\\r\\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\\r\\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\r\\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\\r\\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\\r\\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\\r\\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\\r\\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\\r\\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\\r\\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\r\\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\\r\\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\r\\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\\r\\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\\r\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\r\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\r\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\r\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\r\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\r\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\r\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\r\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\r\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\r\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\r\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\r\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\r\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\r\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\r\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\r\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\r\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\r\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\r\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\r\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\r\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\r\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\r\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\r\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\r\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\r\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\r\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\r\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\r\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\r\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\r\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\r\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\r\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\r\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\r\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\r\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\r\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\r\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\r\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\r\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\r\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\r\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\r\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\r\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\r\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\r\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\r\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\r\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\r\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\r\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\r\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\r\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\r\\nCan I demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I can give thee more,\\r\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\r\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\r\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\r\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\r\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\r\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\r\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\r\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\r\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\r\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.'"

            "Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.No, for then we should be colliers.I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.I strike quickly, being moved.But thou art not quickly moved to strike.A dog of the house of Montague moves me.To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thouart moved, thou runn’st away.A dog of that house shall move me to stand.I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust tothe wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, andthrust his maids to the wall.The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with themen I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.The heads of the maids?Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sensethou wilt.They must take it in sense that feel it.Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am apretty piece of flesh.’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues. Enter Abram and Balthasar.My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.How? Turn thy back and run?Fear me not.No, marry; I fear thee!Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace tothem if they bear it.Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?I do bite my thumb, sir.Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?Is the law of our side if I say ay?No.No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.Do you quarrel, sir?Quarrel, sir? No, sir.But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.No better.Well, sir. Enter Benvolio.Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.Yes, better, sir.You lie.Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow. [_They fight._]Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do. [_Beats down their swords._] Enter Tybalt.What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,Or manage it to part these men with me.What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the wordAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:Have at thee, coward. [_They fight._] Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,That quench the fire of your pernicious rageWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,On pain of torture, from those bloody handsThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the groundAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,And made Verona’s ancient citizensCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,To wield old partisans, in hands as old,Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.If ever you disturb our streets again,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.For this time all the rest depart away:You, Capulet, shall go along with me,And Montague, come you this afternoon,To know our farther pleasure in this case,To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt, Citizens and Servants._]Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?Here were the servants of your adversaryAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.I drew to part them, in the instant cameThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,He swung about his head, and cut the winds,Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.While we were interchanging thrusts and blowsCame more and more, and fought on part and part,Till the Prince came, who parted either part. O where is Romeo, saw you him today?Right glad I am he was not at this fray.Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sunPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,Where underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from this city side,So early walking did I see your son.Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,And stole into the covert of the wood.I, measuring his affections by my own,Which then most sought where most might not be found,Being one too many by my weary self,Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.Many a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the farthest east begin to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,Away from light steals home my heavy son,And private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight outAnd makes himself an artificial night.Black and portentous must this humour prove,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.My noble uncle, do you know the cause?I neither know it nor can learn of him.Have you importun’d him by any means?Both by myself and many other friends;But he, his own affections’ counsellor,Is to himself—I will not say how true—But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious wormEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter Romeo.See, where he comes. So please you step aside;I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.I would thou wert so happy by thy stayTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away, [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]Good morrow, cousin.Is the day so young?But new struck nine.Ay me, sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fast?It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?Not having that which, having, makes them short.In love?Out.Of love?Out of her favour where I am in love.Alas that love so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!O anything, of nothing first create!O heavy lightness! serious vanity!Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!This love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laugh?No coz, I rather weep.Good heart, at what?At thy good heart’s oppression.Why such is love’s transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate to have it prestWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:What is it else? A madness most discreet,A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz. [_Going._]Soft! I will go along:And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.Tell me in sadness who is that you love?What, shall I groan and tell thee?Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hitWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.She will not stay the siege of loving termsNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:O she’s rich in beauty, only poorThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;For beauty starv’d with her severity,Cuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair.She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.O teach me how I should forget to think.By giving liberty unto thine eyes;Examine other beauties.’Tis the wayTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.Show me a mistress that is passing fair,What doth her beauty serve but as a noteWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. [_Exeunt._] Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.But Montague is bound as well as I,In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,For men so old as we to keep the peace.Of honourable reckoning are you both,And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.But now my lord, what say you to my suit?But saying o’er what I have said before.My child is yet a stranger in the world,She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;Let two more summers wither in their prideEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.Younger than she are happy mothers made.And too soon marr’d are those so early made.The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,She is the hopeful lady of my earth:But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,My will to her consent is but a part;And she agree, within her scope of choiceLies my consent and fair according voice.This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,Whereto I have invited many a guest,Such as I love, and you among the store,One more, most welcome, makes my number more.At my poor house look to behold this nightEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:Such comfort as do lusty young men feelWhen well apparell’d April on the heelOf limping winter treads, even such delightAmong fresh female buds shall you this nightInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,And like her most whose merit most shall be:Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,May stand in number, though in reckoning none.Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge aboutThrough fair Verona; find those persons outWhose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that theshoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, thefisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent tofind those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find whatnames the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In goodtime! Enter Benvolio and Romeo.Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:Take thou some new infection to thy eye,And the rank poison of the old will die.Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.For what, I pray thee?For your broken shin.Why, Romeo, art thou mad?Not mad, but bound more than a madman is:Shut up in prison, kept without my food,Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.Perhaps you have learned it without book.But I pray, can you read anything you see?Ay, If I know the letters and the language.Ye say honestly, rest you merry!Stay, fellow; I can read. [_He reads the letter._]_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;The lady widow of Utruvio;Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;Mercutio and his brother Valentine;Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;Lucio and the lively Helena. _A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?Up.Whither to supper?To our house.Whose house?My master’s.Indeed I should have ask’d you that before.Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush acup of wine. Rest you merry. [_Exit._]At this same ancient feast of Capulet’sSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;With all the admired beauties of Verona.Go thither and with unattainted eye,Compare her face with some that I shall show,And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.When the devout religion of mine eyeMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;And these who, often drown’d, could never die,Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sunNe’er saw her match since first the world begun.Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’dYour lady’s love against some other maidThat I will show you shining at this feast,And she shall scant show well that now shows best.I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [_Exeunt._] Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse. Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet! Enter Juliet.How now, who calls?Your mother.Madam, I am here. What is your will? This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. She’s not fourteen.I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,She is not fourteen. How long is it nowTo Lammas-tide? A fortnight and odd days.Even or odd, of all days in the year,Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;She was too good for me. But as I said,On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;That shall she, marry; I remember it well.’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,Of all the days of the year, upon that day:For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;My lord and you were then at Mantua:Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,To bid me trudge.And since that time it is eleven years;For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’roodShe could have run and waddled all about;For even the day before she broke her brow,And then my husband,—God be with his soul!A was a merry man,—took up the child:‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.To see now how a jest shall come about.I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’ Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;And yet I warrant it had upon it browA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his graceThou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. Marry, that marry is the very themeI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,How stands your disposition to be married?It is an honour that I dream not of.An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat. Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,Are made already mothers. By my countI was your mother much upon these yearsThat you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.A man, young lady! Lady, such a manAs all the world—why he’s a man of wax. Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower. What say you, can you love the gentleman?This night you shall behold him at our feast;Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.Examine every married lineament,And see how one another lends content;And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,Find written in the margent of his eyes.This precious book of love, this unbound lover,To beautify him, only lacks a cover:The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much prideFor fair without the fair within to hide.That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;So shall you share all that he doth possess,By having him, making yourself no less.No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:But no more deep will I endart mine eyeThan your consent gives strength to make it fly. Enter a Servant.Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young ladyasked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight. We follow thee. [_Exit Servant._]Juliet, the County stays.Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. [_Exeunt._] Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers; Torch-bearers and others.What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?Or shall we on without apology?The date is out of such prolixity:We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spokeAfter the prompter, for our entrance:But let them measure us by what they will,We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;Being but heavy I will bear the light.Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,With nimble soles, I have a soul of leadSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,And soar with them above a common bound.I am too sore enpierced with his shaftTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.And, to sink in it, should you burden love;Too great oppression for a tender thing.Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.If love be rough with you, be rough with love;Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]A visor for a visor. What care IWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.Come, knock and enter; and no sooner inBut every man betake him to his legs.A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mireOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickestUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.Nay, that’s not so.I mean sir, in delayWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.Take our good meaning, for our judgment sitsFive times in that ere once in our five wits.And we mean well in going to this mask;But ’tis no wit to go.Why, may one ask?I dreamt a dream tonight.And so did I.Well what was yours?That dreamers often lie.In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate-stoneOn the fore-finger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,Not half so big as a round little wormPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by nightThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,Then dreams he of another benefice:Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,Of healths five fathom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,And sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night;And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them, and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she,—Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,Thou talk’st of nothing.True, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,Which is as thin of substance as the air,And more inconstant than the wind, who wooesEven now the frozen bosom of the north,And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:Supper is done, and we shall come too late.I fear too early: for my mind misgivesSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,Shall bitterly begin his fearful dateWith this night’s revels; and expire the termOf a despised life, clos’d in my breastBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.But he that hath the steerage of my courseDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!Strike, drum. [_Exeunt._] Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and theyunwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to theplate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!Ay, boy, ready.You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in thegreat chamber.We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, andthe longer liver take all. [_Exeunt._] Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toesUnplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.Ah my mistresses, which of you allWill now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the dayThat I have worn a visor, and could tellA whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls. [_Music plays, and they dance._]More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,For you and I are past our dancing days;How long is’t now since last yourself and IWere in a mask?By’r Lady, thirty years.What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;His son is thirty.Will you tell me that?His son was but a ward two years ago.What lady is that, which doth enrich the handOf yonder knight?I know not, sir.O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!It seems she hangs upon the cheek of nightAs a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!So shows a snowy dove trooping with crowsAs yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.This by his voice, should be a Montague.Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slaveCome hither, cover’d with an antic face,To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?Now by the stock and honour of my kin,To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.Why how now, kinsman!Wherefore storm you so?Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;A villain that is hither come in spite,To scorn at our solemnity this night.Young Romeo, is it?’Tis he, that villain Romeo.Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,A bears him like a portly gentleman;And, to say truth, Verona brags of himTo be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.I would not for the wealth of all the townHere in my house do him disparagement.Therefore be patient, take no note of him,It is my will; the which if thou respect,Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.It fits when such a villain is a guest:I’ll not endure him.He shall be endur’d.What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;Am I the master here, or you? Go to.You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.Go to, go to!You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.Patience perforce with wilful choler meetingMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall. [_Exit._][_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest handThis holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready standTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,Which mannerly devotion shows in this;For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.[_Kissing her._]Then have my lips the sin that they have took.Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!Give me my sin again.You kiss by the book.Madam, your mother craves a word with you.What is her mother?Marry, bachelor,Her mother is the lady of the house,And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.I tell you, he that can lay hold of herShall have the chinks.Is she a Capulet?O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,I’ll to my rest. [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?The son and heir of old Tiberio.What’s he that now is going out of door?Marry, that I think be young Petruchio.What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?I know not.Go ask his name. If he be married,My grave is like to be my wedding bed.His name is Romeo, and a Montague,The only son of your great enemy.My only love sprung from my only hate!Too early seen unknown, and known too late!Prodigious birth of love it is to me,That I must love a loathed enemy.What’s this? What’s this?A rhyme I learn’d even nowOf one I danc’d withal. [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]Anon, anon!Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone. [_Exeunt._] Enter Chorus.Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,And young affection gapes to be his heir;That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:Being held a foe, he may not have accessTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;And she as much in love, her means much lessTo meet her new beloved anywhere.But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,Tempering extremities with extreme sweet. [_Exit._] Enter Romeo.Can I go forward when my heart is here?Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._] Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!He is wise,And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:Call, good Mercutio.Nay, I’ll conjure too.Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,One nickname for her purblind son and heir,Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trimWhen King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,That in thy likeness thou appear to us.An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger himTo raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,Of some strange nature, letting it there standTill she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;That were some spite. My invocationIs fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,I conjure only but to raise up him.Come, he hath hid himself among these treesTo be consorted with the humorous night.Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.Now will he sit under a medlar tree,And wish his mistress were that kind of fruitAs maids call medlars when they laugh alone.O Romeo, that she were, O that she wereAn open-arse and thou a poperin pear!Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.Come, shall we go?Go then; for ’tis in vainTo seek him here that means not to be found. [_Exeunt._] Enter Romeo.He jests at scars that never felt a wound. Juliet appears above at a window.But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,Who is already sick and pale with grief,That thou her maid art far more fair than she.Be not her maid since she is envious;Her vestal livery is but sick and green,And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.It is my lady, O it is my love!O, that she knew she were!She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?Her eye discourses, I will answer it.I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,Having some business, do entreat her eyesTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.What if her eyes were there, they in her head?The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heavenWould through the airy region stream so brightThat birds would sing and think it were not night.See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.O that I were a glove upon that hand,That I might touch that cheek.Ay me.She speaks.O speak again bright angel, for thou artAs glorious to this night, being o’er my head,As is a winged messenger of heavenUnto the white-upturned wondering eyesOf mortals that fall back to gaze on himWhen he bestrides the lazy-puffing cloudsAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?Deny thy father and refuse thy name.Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,Nor arm, nor face, nor any other partBelonging to a man. O be some other name.What’s in a name? That which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweet;So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,Retain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,And for thy name, which is no part of thee,Take all myself.I take thee at thy word.Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;Henceforth I never will be Romeo.What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in nightSo stumblest on my counsel?By a nameI know not how to tell thee who I am:My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,Because it is an enemy to thee.Had I it written, I would tear the word.My ears have yet not drunk a hundred wordsOf thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,And the place death, considering who thou art,If any of my kinsmen find thee here.With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,For stony limits cannot hold love out,And what love can do, that dares love attempt:Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.If they do see thee, they will murder thee.Alack, there lies more peril in thine eyeThan twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,And I am proof against their enmity.I would not for the world they saw thee here.I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,And but thou love me, let them find me here.My life were better ended by their hateThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.By whose direction found’st thou out this place?By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.I am no pilot; yet wert thou as farAs that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,I should adventure for such merchandise.Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment.Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more trueThan those that have more cunning to be strange.I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,And not impute this yielding to light love,Which the dark night hath so discovered.Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her circled orb,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.What shall I swear by?Do not swear at all.Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I’ll believe thee.If my heart’s dear love,—Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,I have no joy of this contract tonight;It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,Too like the lightning, which doth cease to beEre one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.Good night, good night. As sweet repose and restCome to thy heart as that within my breast.O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;And yet I would it were to give again.Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?But to be frank and give it thee again.And yet I wish but for the thing I have;My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep; the more I give to thee,The more I have, for both are infinite.I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.[_Nurse calls within._]Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.Stay but a little, I will come again. [_Exit._]O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,Being in night, all this is but a dream,Too flattering sweet to be substantial. Enter Juliet above.Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.If that thy bent of love be honourable,Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll layAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.[_Within._] Madam.I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,I do beseech thee,—[_Within._] Madam.By and by I come—To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.Tomorrow will I send.So thrive my soul,—A thousand times good night. [_Exit._]A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. [_Retiring slowly._] Re-enter Juliet, above.Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voiceTo lure this tassel-gentle back again.Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mineWith repetition of my Romeo’s name.It is my soul that calls upon my name.How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,Like softest music to attending ears.Romeo.My nyas?What o’clock tomorrowShall I send to thee?By the hour of nine.I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.I have forgot why I did call thee back.Let me stand here till thou remember it.I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,Remembering how I love thy company.And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,Forgetting any other home but this.’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,That lets it hop a little from her hand,Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,And with a silk thread plucks it back again,So loving-jealous of his liberty.I would I were thy bird.Sweet, so would I:Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrowThat I shall say good night till it be morrow. [_Exit._]Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;And darkness fleckled like a drunkard reelsFrom forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheelsHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. [_Exit._] Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,I must upfill this osier cage of oursWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;What is her burying grave, that is her womb:And from her womb children of divers kindWe sucking on her natural bosom find.Many for many virtues excellent,None but for some, and yet all different.O, mickle is the powerful grace that liesIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.For naught so vile that on the earth doth liveBut to the earth some special good doth give;Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,And vice sometime’s by action dignified. Enter Romeo.Within the infant rind of this weak flowerPoison hath residence, and medicine power:For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.Two such opposed kings encamp them stillIn man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;And where the worser is predominant,Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.Good morrow, father.Benedicite!What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?Young son, it argues a distemper’d headSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,And where care lodges sleep will never lie;But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brainDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.Therefore thy earliness doth me assureThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;Or if not so, then here I hit it right,Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.I have been feasting with mine enemy,Where on a sudden one hath wounded meThat’s by me wounded. Both our remediesWithin thy help and holy physic lies.I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,My intercession likewise steads my foe.Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is setOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;And all combin’d, save what thou must combineBy holy marriage. When, and where, and howWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,That thou consent to marry us today.Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.Jesu Maria, what a deal of brineHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!How much salt water thrown away in waste,To season love, that of it doth not taste.The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sitOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.And bad’st me bury love.Not in a graveTo lay one in, another out to have.I pray thee chide me not, her I love nowDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.The other did not so.O, she knew wellThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.But come young waverer, come go with me,In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;For this alliance may so happy prove,To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. [_Exeunt._] Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man.Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him sothat he will sure run mad.Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’shouse.A challenge, on my life.Romeo will answer it.Any man that can write may answer a letter.Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s blackeye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heartcleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounterTybalt?Why, what is Tybalt?More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain ofcompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third inyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.The what?The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tunersof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very goodwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we shouldbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannotsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones! Enter Romeo.Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thoufishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, tohis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love toberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildingsand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. SigniorRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. Yougave us the counterfeit fairly last night.Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case asmine a man may strain courtesy.That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bowin the hams.Meaning, to curtsy.Thou hast most kindly hit it.A most courteous exposition.Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.Pink for flower.Right.Why, then is my pump well flowered.Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after thewearing, solely singular.O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hastmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in mywhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for thegoose.I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.Nay, good goose, bite not.Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to anell broad.I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, provesthee far and wide a broad goose.Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thousociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art aswell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.Stop there, stop there.Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to thewhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument nolonger. Enter Nurse and Peter.Here’s goodly gear!A sail, a sail!Two, two; a shirt and a smock.Peter!Anon.My fan, Peter.Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.God ye good morrow, gentlemen.God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.Is it good-den?’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon theprick of noon.Out upon you! What a man are you?One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found himthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, forfault of a worse.You say well.Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.She will endite him to some supper.A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!What hast thou found?No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is somethingstale and hoar ere it be spent.[_Sings._]    An old hare hoar,    And an old hare hoar,  Is very good meat in Lent;    But a hare that is hoar    Is too much for a score  When it hoars ere it be spent.Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.I will follow you.Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady. [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of hisropery?A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speakmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustierthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find thosethat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none ofhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave touse me at his pleasure!I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon shouldquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as anotherman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvyknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid meenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But firstlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as theysay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for thegentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double withher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, andvery weak dealing. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest untothee,—Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she willbe a joyful woman.What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is agentlemanlike offer.Bid her deviseSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cellBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.No truly, sir; not a penny.Go to; I say you shall.This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.Within this hour my man shall be with thee,And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,Which to the high topgallant of my joyMust be my convoy in the secret night.Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.Now God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,Two may keep counsel, putting one away?I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas alittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, thatwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see atoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her thatParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, shelooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary andRomeo begin both with a letter?Ay, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it beginswith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.Commend me to thy lady.Ay, a thousand times. Peter! [_Exit Romeo._]Anon.Before and apace. [_Exeunt._] Enter Juliet.The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,In half an hour she promised to return.Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,Driving back shadows over lowering hills:Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.Now is the sun upon the highmost hillOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelveIs three long hours, yet she is not come.Had she affections and warm youthful blood,She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;My words would bandy her to my sweet love,And his to me.But old folks, many feign as they were dead;Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. Enter Nurse and Peter.O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.Peter, stay at the gate. [_Exit Peter._]Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet newsBy playing it to me with so sour a face.I am aweary, give me leave awhile;Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I amout of breath?How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breathTo say to me that thou art out of breath?The excuse that thou dost make in this delayIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet hisleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, thoughthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not theflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thyways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?No, no. But all this did I know before.What says he of our marriage? What of that?Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!Beshrew your heart for sending me aboutTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?Your love says like an honest gentleman,And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?Where is my mother? Why, she is within.Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,‘Where is your mother?’O God’s lady dear,Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.Is this the poultice for my aching bones?Henceforward do your messages yourself.Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?Have you got leave to go to shrift today?I have.Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;There stays a husband to make you a wife.Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.Hie you to church. I must another way,To fetch a ladder by the which your loveMust climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;But you shall bear the burden soon at night.Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell. [_Exeunt._] Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.So smile the heavens upon this holy actThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,It cannot countervail the exchange of joyThat one short minute gives me in her sight.Do thou but close our hands with holy words,Then love-devouring death do what he dare,It is enough I may but call her mine.These violent delights have violent ends,And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honeyIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,And in the taste confounds the appetite.Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. Enter Juliet.Here comes the lady. O, so light a footWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.A lover may bestride the gossamersThat idles in the wanton summer airAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.Good even to my ghostly confessor.Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.As much to him, else is his thanks too much.Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joyBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be moreTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breathThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongueUnfold the imagin’d happiness that bothReceive in either by this dear encounter.Conceit more rich in matter than in words,Brags of his substance, not of ornament.They are but beggars that can count their worth;But my true love is grown to such excess,I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.Come, come with me, and we will make short work,For, by your leaves, you shall not stay aloneTill holy church incorporate two in one. [_Exeunt._] Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines ofa tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me noneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on thedrawer, when indeed there is no need.Am I like such a fellow?Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and assoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.And what to?Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one wouldkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath ahair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrelwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thouhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thyhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hastquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hathwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fallout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? withanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilttutor me from quarrelling!And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the feesimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.The fee simple! O simple! Enter Tybalt and others.By my head, here comes the Capulets.By my heel, I care not.Follow me close, for I will speak to them.Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it aword and a blow.You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give meoccasion.Could you not take some occasion without giving?Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels ofus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’sthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!We talk here in the public haunt of men.Either withdraw unto some private place,And reason coldly of your grievances,Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I. Enter Romeo.Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;Your worship in that sense may call him man.Romeo, the love I bear thee can affordNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.Tybalt, the reason that I have to love theeDoth much excuse the appertaining rageTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.Boy, this shall not excuse the injuriesThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.I do protest I never injur’d thee,But love thee better than thou canst deviseTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.And so good Capulet, which name I tenderAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.O calm, dishonourable, vile submission![_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?What wouldst thou have with me?Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean tomake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the restof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.[_Drawing._] I am for you.Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.Come, sir, your passado. [_They fight._]Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hathForbid this bandying in Verona streets.Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio! [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]I am hurt.A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.Is he gone, and hath nothing?What, art thou hurt?Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon. [_Exit Page._]Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tisenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me agrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ bothyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man todeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book ofarithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under yourarm.I thought all for the best.Help me into some house, Benvolio,Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.They have made worms’ meat of me.I have it, and soundly too. Your houses! [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,My very friend, hath got his mortal hurtIn my behalf; my reputation stain’dWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hourHath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,Thy beauty hath made me effeminateAnd in my temper soften’d valour’s steel. Re-enter Benvolio.O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;This but begins the woe others must end. Re-enter Tybalt.Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?Away to heaven respective lenity,And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back againThat late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soulIs but a little way above our heads,Staying for thine to keep him company.Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,Shalt with him hence.This shall determine that. [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]Romeo, away, be gone!The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee deathIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!O, I am fortune’s fool!Why dost thou stay? [_Exit Romeo._] Enter Citizens.Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?There lies that Tybalt.Up, sir, go with me.I charge thee in the Prince’s name obey. Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.Where are the vile beginners of this fray?O noble Prince, I can discover allThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’dOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.O cousin, cousin.Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethinkHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withalYour high displeasure. All this utteredWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’dCould not take truce with the unruly spleenOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tiltsWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beatsCold death aside, and with the other sendsIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterityRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,His agile arm beats down their fatal points,And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose armAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.But by and by comes back to Romeo,Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere ICould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. He is a kinsman to the Montague.Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,And all those twenty could but kill one life.I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;His fault concludes but what the law should end,The life of Tybalt.And for that offenceImmediately we do exile him hence.I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fineThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.Bear hence this body, and attend our will.Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. [_Exeunt._] Enter Juliet.Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggonerAs Phaeton would whip you to the westAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,That runaway’s eyes may wink, and RomeoLeap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.Lovers can see to do their amorous ritesBy their own beauties: or, if love be blind,It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning match,Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with night,And pay no worship to the garish sun.O, I have bought the mansion of a love,But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,And she brings news, and every tongue that speaksBut Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence. Enter Nurse, with cords.Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?Ay, ay, the cords. [_Throws them down._]Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!We are undone, lady, we are undone.Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.Can heaven be so envious?Romeo can,Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,And that bare vowel I shall poison moreThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.I am not I if there be such an I;Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!That ever I should live to see thee dead.What storm is this that blows so contrary?Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,For who is living, if those two are gone?Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?It did, it did; alas the day, it did.O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!Despised substance of divinest show!Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,A damned saint, an honourable villain!O nature, what hadst thou to do in hellWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiendIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?Was ever book containing such vile matterSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwellIn such a gorgeous palace.There’s no trust,No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.Shame come to Romeo.Blister’d be thy tongueFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’dSole monarch of the universal earth.O, what a beast was I to chide at him!Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,Your tributary drops belong to woe,Which you mistaking offer up to joy.My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,But O, it presses to my memoryLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s deathWas woe enough, if it had ended there.Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that wordIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.He made you for a highway to my bed,But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.Hie to your chamber. I’ll find RomeoTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.O find him, give this ring to my true knight,And bid him come to take his last farewell. [_Exeunt._] Enter Friar Lawrence.Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.Affliction is enanmour’d of thy partsAnd thou art wedded to calamity. Enter Romeo.Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,That I yet know not?Too familiarIs my dear son with such sour company.I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;For exile hath more terror in his look,Much more than death. Do not say banishment.Hence from Verona art thou banished.Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.There is no world without Verona walls,But purgatory, torture, hell itself.Hence banished is banish’d from the world,And world’s exile is death. Then banishedIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,And turn’d that black word death to banishment.This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is hereWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,And little mouse, every unworthy thing,Live here in heaven and may look on her,But Romeo may not. More validity,More honourable state, more courtship livesIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seizeOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,And steal immortal blessing from her lips,Who, even in pure and vestal modestyStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.But Romeo may not, he is banished.This may flies do, when I from this must fly.They are free men but I am banished.And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,But banished to kill me? Banished?O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.Howlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,To mangle me with that word banished?Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,To comfort thee, though thou art banished.Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.O, then I see that mad men have no ears.How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,Doting like me, and like me banished,Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,And fall upon the ground as I do now,Taking the measure of an unmade grave. [_Knocking within._]Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groansMist-like infold me from the search of eyes. [_Knocking._]Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up. [_Knocking._]Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,What simpleness is this.—I come, I come. [_Knocking._]Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.I come from Lady Juliet.Welcome then. Enter Nurse.O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.O, he is even in my mistress’ case.Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.Why should you fall into so deep an O?Nurse.Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?Doth not she think me an old murderer,Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joyWith blood remov’d but little from her own?Where is she? And how doth she? And what saysMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,And then down falls again.As if that name,Shot from the deadly level of a gun,Did murder her, as that name’s cursed handMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,In what vile part of this anatomyDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sackThe hateful mansion. [_Drawing his sword._]Hold thy desperate hand.Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denoteThe unreasonable fury of a beast.Unseemly woman in a seeming man,And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,I thought thy disposition better temper’d.Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,By doing damned hate upon thyself?Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meetIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,And usest none in that true use indeedWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,Digressing from the valour of a man;Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,Misshapen in the conduct of them both,Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,Is set afire by thine own ignorance,And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.A pack of blessings light upon thy back;Happiness courts thee in her best array;But like a misshaped and sullen wench,Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.But look thou stay not till the watch be set,For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;Where thou shalt live till we can find a timeTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee backWith twenty hundred thousand times more joyThan thou went’st forth in lamentation.Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,And bid her hasten all the house to bed,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.Romeo is coming.O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the nightTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. [_Exit._]How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:Either be gone before the watch be set,Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,And he shall signify from time to timeEvery good hap to you that chances here.Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.But that a joy past joy calls out on me,It were a grief so brief to part with thee.Farewell. [_Exeunt._] Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckilyThat we have had no time to move our daughter.Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,And so did I. Well, we were born to die.’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.I promise you, but for your company,I would have been abed an hour ago.These times of woe afford no tune to woo.Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter. I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tenderOf my child’s love. I think she will be rul’dIn all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,But, soft, what day is this?Monday, my lord.Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,She shall be married to this noble earl.Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,It may be thought we held him carelessly,Being our kinsman, if we revel much.Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!Afore me, it is so very very late that weMay call it early by and by. Good night. [_Exeunt._] Enter Romeo and Juliet.Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.It was the nightingale, and not the lark,That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.It was the lark, the herald of the morn,No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaksDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east.Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund dayStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.I must be gone and live, or stay and die.Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.It is some meteor that the sun exhalesTo be to thee this night a torchbearerAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,I am content, so thou wilt have it so.I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beatThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.I have more care to stay than will to go.Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.It is the lark that sings so out of tune,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.Some say the lark makes sweet division;This doth not so, for she divideth us.Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.O now be gone, more light and light it grows.More light and light, more dark and dark our woes. Enter Nurse.Madam.Nurse?Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.The day is broke, be wary, look about. [_Exit._]Then, window, let day in, and let life out.Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend. [_Descends._]Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,I must hear from thee every day in the hour,For in a minute there are many days.O, by this count I shall be much in yearsEre I again behold my Romeo.Farewell!I will omit no opportunityThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serveFor sweet discourses in our time to come.O God! I have an ill-divining soul!Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu. [_Exit below._]O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,If thou art fickle, what dost thou with himThat is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him longBut send him back. [_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?Is she not down so late, or up so early?What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither? Enter Lady Capulet. Why, how now, Juliet?Madam, I am not well. Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,But much of grief shows still some want of wit.Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friendWhich you weep for.Feeling so the loss,I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his deathAs that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.What villain, madam? That same villain Romeo.Villain and he be many miles asunder.God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. That is because the traitor murderer lives.Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dramThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company:And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.Indeed I never shall be satisfiedWith Romeo till I behold him—dead—Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.Madam, if you could find out but a manTo bear a poison, I would temper it,That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhorsTo hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,To wreak the love I bore my cousinUpon his body that hath slaughter’d him. Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.And joy comes well in such a needy time.What are they, I beseech your ladyship? Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;One who to put thee from thy heaviness,Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.Madam, in happy time, what day is that? Marry, my child, early next Thursday mornThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,He shall not make me there a joyful bride.I wonder at this haste, that I must wedEre he that should be husband comes to woo.I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swearIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,Rather than Paris. These are news indeed. Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,And see how he will take it at your hands. Enter Capulet and Nurse.When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;But for the sunset of my brother’s sonIt rains downright.How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?Evermore showering? In one little bodyThou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,Who raging with thy tears and they with them,Without a sudden calm will oversetThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?Have you deliver’d to her our decree? Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.I would the fool were married to her grave.Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,Unworthy as she is, that we have wroughtSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.Proud can I never be of what I hate;But thankful even for hate that is meant love.How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday nextTo go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!You tallow-face! Fie, fie! What, are you mad?Good father, I beseech you on my knees,Hear me with patience but to speak a word.Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,Or never after look me in the face.Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blestThat God had lent us but this only child;But now I see this one is one too much,And that we have a curse in having her.Out on her, hilding.God in heaven bless her.You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.I speak no treason.O God ye good-en!May not one speak?Peace, you mumbling fool!Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,For here we need it not. You are too hot.God’s bread, it makes me mad!Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,Alone, in company, still my care hath beenTo have her match’d, and having now providedA gentleman of noble parentage,Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,And then to have a wretched puling fool,A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn. [_Exit._]Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,That sees into the bottom of my grief?O sweet my mother, cast me not away,Delay this marriage for a month, a week,Or, if you do not, make the bridal bedIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies. Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. [_Exit._]O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.How shall that faith return again to earth,Unless that husband send it me from heavenBy leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagemsUpon so soft a subject as myself.What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?Some comfort, Nurse.Faith, here it is.Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothingThat he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,I think it best you married with the County.O, he’s a lovely gentleman.Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eyeAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,I think you are happy in this second match,For it excels your first: or if it did not,Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,As living here and you no use of him.Speakest thou from thy heart?And from my soul too,Or else beshrew them both.Amen.What?Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,To make confession and to be absolv’d.Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. [_Exit._]Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongueWhich she hath prais’d him with above compareSo many thousand times? Go, counsellor.Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.If all else fail, myself have power to die. [_Exit._] Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.My father Capulet will have it so;And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.You say you do not know the lady’s mind.Uneven is the course; I like it not.Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,And therefore have I little talk’d of love;For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.Now, sir, her father counts it dangerousThat she do give her sorrow so much sway;And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,To stop the inundation of her tears,Which, too much minded by herself alone,May be put from her by society.Now do you know the reason of this haste.[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. Enter Juliet.Happily met, my lady and my wife!That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.What must be shall be.That’s a certain text.Come you to make confession to this father?To answer that, I should confess to you.Do not deny to him that you love me.I will confess to you that I love him.So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.If I do so, it will be of more price,Being spoke behind your back than to your face.Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.The tears have got small victory by that;For it was bad enough before their spite.Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,And what I spake, I spake it to my face.Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.It may be so, for it is not mine own.Are you at leisure, holy father, now,Or shall I come to you at evening mass?My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—My lord, we must entreat the time alone.God shield I should disturb devotion!—Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. [_Exit._]O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!O Juliet, I already know thy grief;It strains me past the compass of my wits.I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,On Thursday next be married to this County.Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,Do thou but call my resolution wise,And with this knife I’ll help it presently.God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,Shall be the label to another deed,Or my true heart with treacherous revoltTurn to another, this shall slay them both.Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,Give me some present counsel, or behold’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knifeShall play the empire, arbitrating thatWhich the commission of thy years and artCould to no issue of true honour bring.Be not so long to speak. I long to die,If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,Which craves as desperate an executionAs that is desperate which we would prevent.If, rather than to marry County ParisThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,Then is it likely thou wilt undertakeA thing like death to chide away this shame,That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,From off the battlements of yonder tower,Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurkWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.Or bid me go into a new-made grave,And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,And I will do it without fear or doubt,To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consentTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.Take thou this vial, being then in bed,And this distilled liquor drink thou off,When presently through all thy veins shall runA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulseShall keep his native progress, but surcease.No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fadeTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,Like death when he shuts up the day of life.Each part depriv’d of supple government,Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk deathThou shalt continue two and forty hours,And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.Now when the bridegroom in the morning comesTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.Then as the manner of our country is,In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vaultWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,And hither shall he come, and he and IWill watch thy waking, and that very nightShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.And this shall free thee from this present shame,If no inconstant toy nor womanish fearAbate thy valour in the acting it.Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperousIn this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speedTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.Farewell, dear father. [_Exeunt._] Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants.So many guests invite as here are writ. [_Exit first Servant._]Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick theirfingers.How canst thou try them so? Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.Go, begone. [_Exit second Servant._]We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?Ay, forsooth.Well, he may chance to do some good on her.A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is. Enter Juliet.See where she comes from shrift with merry look.How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?Where I have learnt me to repent the sinOf disobedient oppositionTo you and your behests; and am enjoin’dBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.Send for the County, go tell him of this.I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,And gave him what becomed love I might,Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,All our whole city is much bound to him.Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,To help me sort such needful ornamentsAs you think fit to furnish me tomorrow? No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow. [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._] We shall be short in our provision,’Tis now near night.Tush, I will stir about,And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—They are all forth: well, I will walk myselfTo County Paris, to prepare him upAgainst tomorrow. My heart is wondrous lightSince this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d. [_Exeunt._] Enter Juliet and Nurse.Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;For I have need of many orisonsTo move the heavens to smile upon my state,Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin. Enter Lady Capulet. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?No, madam; we have cull’d such necessariesAs are behoveful for our state tomorrow.So please you, let me now be left alone,And let the nurse this night sit up with you,For I am sure you have your hands full allIn this so sudden business. Good night.Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need. [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veinsThat almost freezes up the heat of life.I’ll call them back again to comfort me.Nurse!—What should she do here?My dismal scene I needs must act alone.Come, vial.What if this mixture do not work at all?Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there. [_Laying down her dagger._]What if it be a poison, which the FriarSubtly hath minister’d to have me dead,Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,Because he married me before to Romeo?I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,For he hath still been tried a holy man.How if, when I am laid into the tomb,I wake before the time that RomeoCome to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?Or, if I live, is it not very like,The horrible conceit of death and night,Together with the terror of the place,As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,Where for this many hundred years the bonesOf all my buried ancestors are pack’d,Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,At some hours in the night spirits resort—Alack, alack, is it not like that I,So early waking, what with loathsome smells,And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,Environed with all these hideous fears,And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghostSeeking out Romeo that did spit his bodyUpon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee. [_Throws herself on the bed._] Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. Enter Capulet.Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d,The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;Spare not for cost.Go, you cot-quean, go,Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrowFor this night’s watching.No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere nowAll night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;But I will watch you from such watching now. [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood! Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.Now, fellow, what’s there?FIRST Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.Make haste, make haste. [_Exit First Servant._]—Sirrah, fetch drier logs.Call Peter, he will show thee where they are. I have a head, sir, that will find out logsAnd never trouble Peter for the matter. [_Exit._]Mass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha.Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.The County will be here with music straight,For so he said he would. I hear him near. [_Play music._]Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say! Re-enter Nurse.Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up.I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.Make haste I say. [_Exeunt._] Enter Nurse.Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,The County Paris hath set up his restThat you shall rest but little. God forgive me!Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!Ay, let the County take you in your bed,He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!O, well-a-day that ever I was born.Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady! Enter Lady Capulet. What noise is here?O lamentable day! What is the matter?Look, look! O heavy day! O me, O me! My child, my only life.Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.Help, help! Call help. Enter Capulet.For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day! Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.Life and these lips have long been separated.Death lies on her like an untimely frostUpon the sweetest flower of all the field.O lamentable day! O woful time!Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.Come, is the bride ready to go to church?Ready to go, but never to return.O son, the night before thy wedding dayHath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,Flower as she was, deflowered by him.Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;My daughter he hath wedded. I will die.And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,And doth it give me such a sight as this? Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.Most miserable hour that e’er time sawIn lasting labour of his pilgrimage.But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,But one thing to rejoice and solace in,And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.Most lamentable day, most woeful dayThat ever, ever, I did yet behold!O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.Never was seen so black a day as this.O woeful day, O woeful day.Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou nowTo murder, murder our solemnity?O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,And with my child my joys are buried.Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives notIn these confusions. Heaven and yourselfHad part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,And all the better is it for the maid.Your part in her you could not keep from death,But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.The most you sought was her promotion,For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’dAbove the clouds, as high as heaven itself?O, in this love, you love your child so illThat you run mad, seeing that she is well.She’s not well married that lives married long,But she’s best married that dies married young.Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemaryOn this fair corse, and, as the custom is,And in her best array bear her to church;For though fond nature bids us all lament,Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.All things that we ordained festivalTurn from their office to black funeral:Our instruments to melancholy bells,Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,And all things change them to the contrary.Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepareTo follow this fair corse unto her grave.The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;Move them no more by crossing their high will. [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,For well you know this is a pitiful case.Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. [_Exit Nurse._] Enter Peter.Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and youwill have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’Why ‘Heart’s ease’?O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O playme some merry dump to comfort me.Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.You will not then?No.I will then give it you soundly.What will you give us?No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.Then will I give you the serving-creature.Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I willcarry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?And you re us and fa us, you note us.Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, andput up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.    ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,    Then music with her silver sound’—Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,Simon Catling?Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?THIRD MUSICIAN.Faith, I know not what to say.O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold forsounding.      ‘Then music with her silver sound      With speedy help doth lend redress.’ [_Exit._]What a pestilent knave is this same!Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and staydinner. [_Exeunt._] Enter Romeo.If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;And all this day an unaccustom’d spiritLifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy. Enter Balthasar.News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?How doth my lady? Is my father well?How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;For nothing can be ill if she be well.Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,And her immortal part with angels lives.I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,And presently took post to tell it you.O pardon me for bringing these ill news,Since you did leave it for my office, sir.Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.I do beseech you sir, have patience.Your looks are pale and wild, and do importSome misadventure.Tush, thou art deceiv’d.Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?No, my good lord.No matter. Get thee gone,And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight. [_Exit Balthasar._]Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swiftTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.I do remember an apothecary,—And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I notedIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,An alligator stuff’d, and other skinsOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelvesA beggarly account of empty boxes,Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of rosesWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.Noting this penury, to myself I said,And if a man did need a poison now,Whose sale is present death in Mantua,Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.O, this same thought did but forerun my need,And this same needy man must sell it me.As I remember, this should be the house.Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.What, ho! Apothecary! Enter Apothecary.Who calls so loud?Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me haveA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gearAs will disperse itself through all the veins,That the life-weary taker may fall dead,And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breathAs violently as hasty powder fir’dDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s lawIs death to any he that utters them.Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;The world affords no law to make thee rich;Then be not poor, but break it and take this.My poverty, but not my will consents.I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.Put this in any liquid thing you willAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strengthOf twenty men, it would despatch you straight.There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,Doing more murder in this loathsome worldThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.Come, cordial and not poison, go with meTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee. [_Exeunt._] Enter Friar John.Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho! Enter Friar Lawrence.This same should be the voice of Friar John.Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.Going to find a barefoot brother out,One of our order, to associate me,Here in this city visiting the sick,And finding him, the searchers of the town,Suspecting that we both were in a houseWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.Who bare my letter then to Romeo?I could not send it,—here it is again,—Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,So fearful were they of infection.Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,The letter was not nice, but full of charge,Of dear import, and the neglecting itMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,Get me an iron crow and bring it straightUnto my cell.Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee. [_Exit._]Now must I to the monument alone.Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.She will beshrew me much that RomeoHath had no notice of these accidents;But I will write again to Mantua,And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb. [_Exit._] Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,As signal that thou hear’st something approach.Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand aloneHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [_Retires._]Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.The obsequies that I for thee will keep,Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. [_The Page whistles._]The boy gives warning something doth approach.What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile. [_Retires._] Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.Hold, take this letter; early in the morningSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloofAnd do not interrupt me in my course.Why I descend into this bed of deathIs partly to behold my lady’s face,But chiefly to take thence from her dead fingerA precious ring, a ring that I must useIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.But if thou jealous dost return to pryIn what I further shall intend to do,By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.The time and my intents are savage-wild;More fierce and more inexorable farThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [_Retires_]Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.This is that banish’d haughty MontagueThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,It is supposed, the fair creature died,—And here is come to do some villanous shameTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. [_Advances._]Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,Put not another sin upon my headBy urging me to fury. O be gone.By heaven I love thee better than myself;For I come hither arm’d against myself.Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.I do defy thy conjuration,And apprehend thee for a felon here.Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy! [_They fight._]O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. [_Exit._]O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [_Dies._]In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!What said my man, when my betossed soulDid not attend him as we rode? I thinkHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makesThis vault a feasting presence full of light.Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d. [_Laying Paris in the monument._]How oft when men are at the point of deathHave they been merry! Which their keepers callA lightning before death. O, how may ICall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yetIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?O, what more favour can I do to theeThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twainTo sunder his that was thine enemy?Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believeThat unsubstantial death is amorous;And that the lean abhorred monster keepsThee here in dark to be his paramour?For fear of that I still will stay with thee,And never from this palace of dim nightDepart again. Here, here will I remainWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, hereWill I set up my everlasting rest;And shake the yoke of inauspicious starsFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O youThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kissA dateless bargain to engrossing death.Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.Thou desperate pilot, now at once run onThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. [_Dies._] Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a lantern, crow, and spade.Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonightHave my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,What torch is yond that vainly lends his lightTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,It burneth in the Capels’ monument.It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,One that you love.Who is it?Romeo.How long hath he been there?Full half an hour.Go with me to the vault.I dare not, sir;My master knows not but I am gone hence,And fearfully did menace me with deathIf I did stay to look on his intents.Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.As I did sleep under this yew tree here,I dreamt my master and another fought,And that my master slew him.Romeo! [_Advances._]Alack, alack, what blood is this which stainsThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?What mean these masterless and gory swordsTo lie discolour’d by this place of peace? [_Enters the monument._]Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hourIs guilty of this lamentable chance?The lady stirs. [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?I do remember well where I should be,And there I am. Where is my Romeo? [_Noise within._]I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nestOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.A greater power than we can contradictHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of theeAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly dropTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips.Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,To make me die with a restorative. [_Kisses him._]Thy lips are warm![_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger. [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die. [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._] Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach. [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,Who here hath lain this two days buried.Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.Raise up the Montagues, some others search. [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,But the true ground of all these piteous woesWe cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar. Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.THIRD  Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.We took this mattock and this spade from himAs he was coming from this churchyard side.A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too. Enter the Prince and Attendants.What misadventure is so early up,That calls our person from our morning’s rest? Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.What should it be that they so shriek abroad? O the people in the street cry Romeo,Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all runWith open outcry toward our monument.What fear is this which startles in our ears?Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,Warm and new kill’d.Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,With instruments upon them fit to openThese dead men’s tombs.O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his houseIs empty on the back of Montague,And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom. O me! This sight of death is as a bellThat warns my old age to a sepulchre. Enter Montague and others.Come, Montague, for thou art early up,To see thy son and heir more early down.Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.What further woe conspires against mine age?Look, and thou shalt see.O thou untaught! What manners is in this,To press before thy father to a grave?Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,Till we can clear these ambiguities,And know their spring, their head, their true descent,And then will I be general of your woes,And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,And let mischance be slave to patience.Bring forth the parties of suspicion.I am the greatest, able to do least,Yet most suspected, as the time and placeDoth make against me, of this direful murder.And here I stand, both to impeach and purgeMyself condemned and myself excus’d.Then say at once what thou dost know in this.I will be brief, for my short date of breathIs not so long as is a tedious tale.Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.I married them; and their stol’n marriage dayWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely deathBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.You, to remove that siege of grief from her,Betroth’d, and would have married her perforceTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,And with wild looks, bid me devise some meansTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,A sleeping potion, which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death. Meantime I writ to RomeoThat he should hither come as this dire nightTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,Being the time the potion’s force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stay’d by accident; and yesternightReturn’d my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixed hour of her wakingCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,Meaning to keep her closely at my cellTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awaking, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes; and I entreated her come forthAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;And she, too desperate, would not go with me,But, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know; and to the marriageHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,Unto the rigour of severest law.We still have known thee for a holy man.Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,And then in post he came from MantuaTo this same place, to this same monument.This letter he early bid me give his father,And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,If I departed not, and left him there.Give me the letter, I will look on it.Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?Sirrah, what made your master in this place?He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,And by and by my master drew on him,And then I ran away to call the watch.This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,Their course of love, the tidings of her death.And here he writes that he did buy a poisonOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithalCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!And I, for winking at your discords too,Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.O brother Montague, give me thy hand.This is my daughter’s jointure, for no moreCan I demand.But I can give thee more,For I will raise her statue in pure gold,That whiles Verona by that name is known,There shall no figure at such rate be setAs that of true and faithful Juliet.As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,Poor sacrifices of our enmity.A glooming peace this morning with it brings;The sun for sorrow will not show his head.Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,For never was a story of more woeThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n"

            "Romeo, the son of Montague, runs into his cousin Benvolio, who had earlier seen Romeo moping in a grove of sycamores. Romeo confides that he is in love with Rosaline, a woman who does not return his affections. Prince Escalus, the ruler of Verona, attempts to prevent any further conflicts between the families. Benvolio counsels him to forget this woman and find another, more beautiful one, but Romeo remains despondent. Meanwhile, Paris, a kinsman of the Prince, seeks Juliet’s hand in marriage. Her father Capulet, though happy at the match, asks Paris to wait two years, since Juliet is not yet even fourteen. Romeo and Benvolio are invited to a feast by the Capulet family. Juliet talks with her mother and nurse about the possibility of marrying Paris. Juliet agrees to look at Paris during the feast to see if she thinks she could fall in love with him. Rosaline, whose name he reads on the list, will be there. A melancholy Romeo follows Benvolio and their witty friend Mercutio to Capulet’s house. Once inside, Romeo sees Juliet from a distance and instantly falls in love with her. As Romeo watches Juliet, Tybalt, recognizes him, and is enraged that a Montague would sneak into a Capulet feast. Romeo and Juliet kiss, not even knowing each other's names. When he finds out from Juliet’s nurse that she is the daughter of Capulet, he becomes distraught. When Juliet learns that the young man she has just kissed is the son of Montague, she grows equally upset. Romeo sees Juliet in a window above the orchard and hears her speak his name. He calls out to her, and they exchange vows of love. Friar Lawrence agrees to marry the young lovers in secret since he sees in their love the possibility of ending the age-old feud between Capulet and Montague. The next day, Benvolio and Mercutio encounter Tybalt—Juliet’s cousin—who has challenged Romeo to a duel. Romeo begs the Capulet to hold off the duel until he understands why Romeo does not want to fight. The two begin to duel. Romeo tries to stop them by leaping between the combatants. Tybalt stabs Mercutio under Romeo’s arm, andMercutio dies. Romeo, in a rage, killsTybalt.Soon after, the Prince declares him forever banished from Verona for his crime. Friar Lawrence arranges for Romeo to spend his wedding night with Juliet before he has to leave for Mantua the following morning. In her room, Juliet awaits the arrival of her new husband. The Nurse enters, and, after some confusion, tells Juliet that Romeo has killed Tybalt. Romeo sneaks into Juliet’s room that night, and at last they consummate their marriage and their love. Juliet learns that her father, affected by the recent events, now intends for her to marry Paris in just three days.Unsure of how to proceed, Juliet asks her nurse for advice. Juliet must drink a potion that will make her appear to be dead the night before her wedding to Paris. After she is laid to rest in the family’s crypt, the Friar and Romeo will secretly retrieve her and she will be free to live with Romeo, away from their parents' feuding. Juliet drinks the potion, and the Nurse discovers her, apparently dead, the next morning. The Capulets grieve, and Juliet is entombed according to plan. Friar Lawrence’s message explaining the plan to Romeo never reaches Mantua. Its bearer, Friar John, gets confined to a quarantined house. Romeo learns only of Juliet's death and decides to kill himself rather than live without her. He buys a vial of poison from a reluctant Apothecary, then speeds back to Verona to take his own life at Juliet's tomb. He enters the tomb, sees Juliet’s inanimate body, drinks the poison, and dies by her side. Juliet sees her beloved Romeo and realizes he has killed himself with poison.Just then, Friar Lawrence enters and realizes that Romeo has killed Paris and himself.At the same time, Juliet awakes.Friar Lawrence hears the coming of the watch and flees alone. She kisses his poisoned lips, and when that does not kill her, buries his dagger in her chest, falling dead upon his body. Montague declares that Lady Montague has died of grief over Romeo's exile. Capulet and Montague agree to end their long-standing feud and to raise gold statues of their children side-by-side.\n"
